# Project Synopsis (Draft)

**Title:** Hybrid Secure File Transfer using AES and XChaCha20

**Objective:**  
To design and implement a hybrid encryption model that uses AES for file stream encryption and XChaCha20 for key protection, ensuring confidentiality and efficiency in data transfer.

**Scope:**  
- Implement AES-256 encryption for large file streams.  
- Secure AES session keys using XChaCha20 (or ChaCha20-Poly1305).  
- Evaluate encryption/decryption speed, accuracy, and basic security checks.  

**Proposed Outcome:**  
A functional prototype capable of encrypting/decrypting files securely, with measured performance results and correctness verification.

**Tools/Technologies:**  
Python, PyCryptodome, PyNaCl, Linux (Ubuntu), GitHub.

**Team Members:**  
- Prajjwal Gupta  
- Pragati Raj
